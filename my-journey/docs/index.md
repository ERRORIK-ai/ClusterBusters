# ClusterBusters Journey

Welcome to my **journal**, documenting my hands-on experience setting up Kubernetes clusters with Civo, Terraform automation, and CI/CD pipelines.


Welcome to my **ClusterBusters Journey**.

_Here I am going to document my experiences (challenges as well as successes) in setting up a Kubernetes cluster using Civo.com as the cloud provider and Terraform to code and deploy the infrastructure._

## What You Will Find Here

- **Terraform**: provider configurations, credentials, and cluster definitions.
- **Civo Setup**: account creation, CLI configuration, and cluster provisioning.
- **Deployment**: applying Terraform, verifying resources, and next steps.
